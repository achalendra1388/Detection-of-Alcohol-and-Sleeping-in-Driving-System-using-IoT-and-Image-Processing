Problem Statement:

Driving under the influence of alcohol and drowsiness are leading causes of road accidents
globally. Despite strict regulations and awareness efforts, accidents due to impaired or fatigued
driving continue to pose serious risks to both drivers and pedestrians. Current detection methods
are often limited in scope, relying heavily on manual monitoring or reactive measures after an
incident has occurred, which are insufficient for effective real-time prevention.
This project aims to develop an IoT and image processing-based detection system to monitor and
alert for signs of alcohol consumption and drowsiness in drivers in real-time. By integrating
sensors and cameras within the vehicle, the system will detect alcohol levels and analyze facial
features to identify signs of sleepiness or fatigue

Abstract
Driving under the influence of alcohol and driver fatigue are major factors contributing to road
accidents worldwide, posing critical risks to both drivers and pedestrians. Despite stringent
regulations and extensive public awareness campaigns, impaired and fatigued driving remain
pressing safety issues due to a lack of reliable, real-time detection and intervention systems.
Many current detection approaches are constrained by their reliance on post-incident analysis or
manual monitoring methods, which do not address the need for immediate preventive action.
This study introduces an IoT- and image processing-based system designed to detect alcohol
consumption and drowsiness in drivers in real-time. Leveraging the combined capabilities of
alcohol sensors and in-car cameras, the system assesses the driver's breath alcohol content and
analyzes facial features to identify signs of drowsiness. Once impairment or fatigue indicators are
detected, the system initiates alerts or other preventive measures, such as activating in-vehicle
alarms or restricting vehicle controls, aimed at reducing the likelihood of accidents.
